            </div>
            <p>Hello! I'm an extremely driven and creative Full Stack Developer who is currently open for career opportunities as a front-end or back-end web developer in the Greater Seattle Area.</p>
            <p>I'm a recent graduate of Coding Dojo, a coding school located in Bellevue, WA that teaches 3 full stacks in 3 months. I'm capable of learning new technologies and languages very quickly, and am always looking for opportunities to further expand my skills and grow as a developer.</p>

                <h2>New Life Roof Care</h2>
            </div>
            <p>New Life Roof Care Inc. is a family owned business within which I have invested my service, dedication, and interest. Through this experience, I have learned to critically analyze the quality of work. What does it take to rise above the rest of the industry? It takes an obsessive compulsive hard working guy. Pride, passion, quality, and proficiency.</p>

            </div>
            <p>References are unique, they provide a simple amount of transparency into a persons life, but...how do you correctly 'vibe' what the reference is telling you? Especially since the to-be-employee knows you'll be calling up a few of his guys to find out more about him. Well, you could simply compile more information from different sources. These days, background checks are done through technology in conjunction with traditional methods.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Application process; element one is feel. How do you feel about the employee, just by first look? Element two is a deeper look at things like amiability, health issues, reliability, overall performance. Third, you'd do a deep analysis that contains a background check. This in includes psychoanalysis, function under stress, etc.... Fourth, you'd do meet him in person and look for idiosynchrocies and telltale signs of character, personality, and vibe. Last you would test his ability to provide the content you desire, check his speed, etc....</p>
